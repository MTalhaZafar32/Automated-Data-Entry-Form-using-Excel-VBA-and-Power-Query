# Automated Data Entry Form using Excel VBA and Power Query

Welcome to the Automated Data Entry Form project! This README provides an overview of the project and guides you through its components and usage.

## Introduction

This repository showcases a project developed during my internship journey at AI Data House. It focuses on automating data entry processes using Excel VBA and Power Query. The project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle, specifically the [Customer Shopping Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehmettahiraslan/customer-shopping-dataset).

## Technologies Used

- **Excel VBA**: Used for creating interactive buttons and forms for data input.
- **Power Query**: Employed for data transformation and integration.
- **Dynamic Path Management**: Implemented to ensure easy updates and maintenance of file paths.

## Project Overview

The project involves:
- Creating a user-friendly button in Excel VBA for browsing and selecting data files.
- Utilizing Power Query to transform and integrate data from the selected files.
- Designing a dynamic user form using VBA to facilitate data entry and update Excel databases.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
1. **src/**: Contains the source code files.
   - `UserForm1`: Excel VBA form for data entry.
   - `Import data`: VBA module for browse and select data.
   - `Data Transformation`: Excel file demonstrating Power Query transformations.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MTalhaZafar32/Automated-Data-Entry-Form-using-Excel-VBA-and-Power-Query.git
   ```
2. Open the Excel workbook and enable macros if prompted.
3. Explore `UserForm1` for file selection and `PowerQueryTransformations` for data transformation data.
4. Modify and extend the project according to your requirements.

## Usage

- Run the Excel VBA macro to open `UserForm1` and select the data file.
- Use Power Query to transform the data as per your needs.
- Utilize the user form for efficient data entry and management.
